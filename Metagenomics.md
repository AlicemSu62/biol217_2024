# Metagenomics

It is of utmost importance to understand the microbial world and processes in the environment. Microbiology enabled new tools for biotechnology such as antibiotics, mimicry, biogas and green chemicals. Metagenomics is a field that can access the complete microbiota (cultivable and uncultivable) and gives answers to the questions how many taxas there are, what they are doing, how they are doing it and what influece they have on the ecosystem. 

Metagenomics is a cultivation-independent method based on short or long-read sequencing. It means the application of modern genomics techniques (sequencing) to study the entirety of a microbial community straight from their natural environment.
